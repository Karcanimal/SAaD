Liam is the owner of DriverPass. He runs a company that helps people pass their driver license test. They do this by offering classes and driving lessons. The system that they wanted to design was an application that was secure and allowed for customer to have online classes that allow them to study and take practice tests. The system also allows for customers to schedule and manage driving lessons. 
The overall design seems to be well thoughtout and can describe the basics of the system. 
The assignment that I would go back and change is the first UML Diagram it was rushed and didn't properly describe the use case.
Understanding the customers wants and needs helped create use cases and influenced the major design elements. It is important to consider the user's needs in the system design since the user is the one that is going to judge the system that you designed.
The first step in the approach of software design is relizing a problem that can be solved with technology. Building use case and UML class, activities, and use case diagrams would be some of the first things that would need to be done.
